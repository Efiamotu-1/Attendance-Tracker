        Welcome to the Attendance tracker application. To begin you would have to create a course or courses depending 
        on the number of courses you are taking for the semester, you can do this by accessing the course tab on the menu. 
        After creating a course you can add daily reports using the reports tab based on whether the class held and whether 
        you attended the class. Please note that these reports are not editable once added so make sure to only create a report 
        when you have all the necessary information aabout a particular class. Alternatively you can edit and delete a course.
